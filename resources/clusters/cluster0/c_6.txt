We don't want to leave a question mark in the minds of fans of boxing, Pacquiao said. It's also very important this fight is for the honor of my country.

The fighters also explained how the long-awaited fight came to be agreed upon. The two happened to meet a Miami Heat game in January, only because Pacquiao's flight out of Miami was delayed by weather. After speaking at the game, Mayweather went to Pacquiao's hotel room and began discussing the possibility of a fight.

The fight was announced on Feb. 20 after years of speculation about whether the two best pound-for-pound fighters of their generation would ever meet in the ring. - Dan Gartland
