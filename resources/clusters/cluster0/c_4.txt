The digital future of the NHS will be the focus of a free Birmingham City University event next week.

'Healthcare in a Digital Age' takes place on Thursday 30 April and will see innovators Edward Miller and Robin Vickers lead discussions on the digitisation of patient information and the integration of services giving patients more control over their healthcare.

Miller, co-founder of Medical Realities, will talk about the company's first product 'The Virtual Surgeon', which aims to reduce the cost of healthcare training with the UK's first 360 degree video capture of a medical operation.

Vickers will demonstrate how his company, Digital Life Sciences, use digital solutions to respond to the real-life everyday challenges faced by medical professionals and healthcare providers.

The event will also showcase the research activities of Birmingham City University's School of Digital Media Technology, which recently received international recognition for its pioneering research into cancer diagnosis.

The event runs from 5.45pm until 8:45pm at the University's City Centre Campus.
