I want to bring this party back to its roots, equality, justice and social welfare. This is the party of Lincoln, but we have strayed from those ideas and become the party of corporations, the military industrial complex, intolerance, religious fanaticism, the rich, and the mean-spirited. That ends here.

Please support me by contributing, ten dollars or less to Mike4President.com.

I dont have a chance in hell, but maybe Ill get to travel a bit and to meet Anderson Cooper!
