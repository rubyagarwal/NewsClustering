Starbucks Corp.s stores opened for business as usual this morning, ready to caffeinate customers after its sales-register system in the U.S. and Canada crashed Friday evening.

The outage was caused by an internal failure during a daily system refresh and wasnt the result of an external breach, the Seattle-based coffee chain said in a statement Saturday on its website.

Stores were prevented from accepting all kinds of payments, including cash and credit cards, leading to some customers getting free coffee. The chains Evolution Fresh and Teavana Tea Bar stores also opened as scheduled Saturday.

We apologize to our customers for this inconvenience, Starbucks said in the statement.

A spokeswoman for Starbucks declined to comment on how much the outage cost the company in sales or provide any further details.
