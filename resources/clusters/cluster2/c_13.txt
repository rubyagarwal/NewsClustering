In the Grizzlies Saturday night win over the Blazers, Mike Conley suffered a facial injury after taking an inadvertent elbow from C.J. McCollum.

Conley tweeted after the game that he was fine, but it turns out that isnt the case. Hes out for Mondays Game 4 in Portland, a potential series clincher for the Grizzlies, after returning to the hospital with a serious facial injury, according to the team.

Mike Conley is headed back to Memphis with a serious facial injury below the left eye. He is out Game 4 with no timetable for his return.  Ronald Tillery (@CAGrizBeat) April 26, 2015

Conley has dealt with foot issues in recent weeks, and his foot seems to be fine. It would be unfortunate if this unrelated injury took him out of the Grizzlies playoff run. Theyre up 3-0 on the Blazers and should still be able to seal the first-round series win this week, but good luck even being competitive against Golden State in the second round without Conley.
