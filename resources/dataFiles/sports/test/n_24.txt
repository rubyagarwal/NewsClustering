<sports>##BREAKING: Brett Gardner is trying to get Alex Rodriguez to grow a mustache
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Its well known that the Yankees have a strict team policy regarding facial hair, but their players are still allowed to grow mustaches. They are taking advantage of it in a big way this season, with Brett Gardner, Dellin Betances, Jacoby Ellsbury, Chase Headley, and Brian McCann among those sporting staches or at least their best attempt at one. However, a certain someone has yet to participate. Could that change?

Brett Gardner said he started the Yankee mustache trend, other guys followed suit  headley, mccann, rogers, ellsbury.. Trying to get ARod.  Daniel Barbarisi (@DanBarbarisi) April 25, 2015

Rodriguez is off to a strong start after his year-long PED suspension, batting .269/.424/.558 with four home runs and 11 RBI over 16 games, but growing a mustache would pretty much clinch the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award for him, no? Its of utmost importance that this happens. We here at HardballTalk wish Gardner luck in his efforts.
