Tensions continue to flare before their May 2 bout

Manny Pacquiaos legendary trainer Freddie Roach says Floyd Mayweather is a bad seed and that he is looking forward to seeing the 38-year-old get knocked out when he squares off with the Filipino superstar in May.

During an interview with sports analyst Jim Rome over the weekend, Roach slated the undefeated welterweight for being very insecure and claimed hes set a poor example for younger generations.

I mean hes not a good guy, hes not a good person, hes not a good role model, said Roach, who added that the usually affable Pacquiao doesnt have much love for Mayweather either.

Ive never seen him dislike an opponent in my life, but you know what, he doesnt like this guy, Roach added.

The trainers comments are just the latest tidbit of controversy to surface as both camps hunker down before their much-anticipated May 2 bout. Earlier this month, Roach told a Philippine news outlet that Mayweathers advisors were paying Pacmans potential sparring partners large sums of money to refrain from participating in his training camp.
