Memphis Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley exited the team's 115109 Game 3 playoffs victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday with a head injury. He was taken to a local medical facility for further evaluation.

Conley was forced out of the game with 3:04 remaining in the third quarter after taking an inadvertent elbow to the head from Portland guard C.J. McCollum. Conley remained on the floor for several seconds while play continued on the opposite end of the court.

Conley was eventually helped off the court by coaches and trainers while holding a towel over his face. His left eye was reportedly swollen as he was taken to the medical facility.

Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger did not have an update after the game, which gave Memphis a 30 lead in the opening-round series.

"To come in here and here and get a win in this kind of environment is a big win for our guys," Joerger said, reports ESPN.com. "For Mike to go down in the course of the game -- I don't know what his status is at this point, and same thing for Beno [Udrih]. We'll see if he can go Monday or not."

Udrih sustained a spring ankle in Game 2 and missed Game 3.
