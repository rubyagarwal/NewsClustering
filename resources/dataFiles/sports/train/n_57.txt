LIEGE, Belgium (AP) Alejandro Valverde timed his attack to perfection to win the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic for the third time in his career on Sunday, clinching the Ardennes double after his midweek victory in the Walloon Arrow.

The 35-year-old Spaniard waited until 500 meters (yards) from the line to chase down countryman Dani Moreno. After overtaking Moreno, Valverde then held off a challenge from Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe - who also finished second behind him in Wednesday's Walloon Arrow.

Valverde, runner-up last weekend in the Amstel Gold Race, last won Liege-Bastogne-Liege in 2008. A handful of riders have won it three times and only Belgian great Eddy Merckx has won it more with five.

Spaniard Joacquim Rodriguez was third, with the top three all timed in 6 hours, 14 minutes, 20 seconds.
