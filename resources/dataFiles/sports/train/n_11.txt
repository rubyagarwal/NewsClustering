Because of what were described as personal issues, Jaxon Hood twice left the Arizona State football program shortly before and then during the 2014 season.

While hes not returned from the second sabbatical, he could in the near future. Maybe.

On his protected Twitter account Friday, Hood proclaimed Im back and [t]he road to greatness continues. When a writer who covers the Sun Devils wrote on Twitter that Hoods tweets insinuate nothing about playing football and that the tweets [c]ould mean anything in [his] personal life, Hood responded.

Well there you go RT @MrJhood7ASU: @NickPKrueger No it's football buddy  Nick Krueger (@NickPKrueger) April 24, 2015

Hold the bus on the Welcome Wagon, though.

The Arizona Republic, citing a source with knowledge of the situation, is reporting that Hood is not officially back with the football team. As of early Sunday afternoon, Hood was not listed on ASUs online roster, although head coach Todd Graham said late this past week that he wouldnt rule out an eventual return.

Such a development would be a positive one for ASUs defensive line rotation.

In starting 12 games as a true freshman in 2012, Hood earned numerous Freshman All-American honors. He was the starter at nose tackle in 2013, then started the first eight games of the season before missing the remainder of the year with his second bout with personal issues.
