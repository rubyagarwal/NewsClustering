Jordan Spieth's Caddie Visits U.S. Open Site Chambers Bay
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Jordan Spieth might be taking this week off from competitive golf, not playing the Zurich Classic just two weeks removed from his 2015 Masters victory, but that doesnt mean his caddie, Michael Greller, is on a break. Greller was out sizing up Chambers Bay, the host of 2015s next major championshipthe 2015 U.S. Open on June 15-21.

Greller, who became infinitely more popular through helping Spieth set records at Augusta National, tweeted from the Chambers Bay caddyshack on Monday, where he coincidentally was a caddie before jumping on Spieths bag full-time.

Having lived in the Pacific Northwest for nearly a decade, Greller seems to provide an extra advantage for Spieth since several players and caddies have yet to visit the course in University Place, Wash.

Enjoyed spending few hours today at Chambers Bay. Incredible venue, dedicated staff and caddyshack looks the same! pic.twitter.com/jY978T7fhW  Michael Greller (@michael_greller) April 20, 2015

Jim Bones Mackay, Phil Mickelson's caddie, alluded to this just the other day on writer Alan Shipnucks podcast, noting how he has only talked to a few people who have ever played the course. (He begins discussing U.S. Open preparation around the 11:43 mark.)

So few people seem to know much about that course, Mackay said. The irony is that the one guy who will know the most about that course is caddying for Jordan Spieth.

Nonetheless, Greller doesnt think his home-course knowledge will provide him much of an advantage.

Honestly, Greller said to the Tacoma News Tribune, sleeping in my own bed and home-cooked meals are a bigger advantage than the knowledge of the course.
