As first reported by Jeff Hem, the play-by-play announcer for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, the Athletics have signed veteran infielder Ryan Roberts to a minor league contract. He is starting at third base and batting fifth for Nashville on Sunday afternoon.

Roberts was released by the Royals near the end of spring training after struggling in the Cactus League. The 34-year-old hasnt been an effective major league player since 2011, when he hit .249/.341/.427 with 19 home runs and 18 stolen bases across 143 games for the Diamondbacks. It was by far his best season.

Roberts went 2-for-19 (.105) in eight games last summer with the Red Sox.
