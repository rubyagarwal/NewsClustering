Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo: Champions League goal record
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo are the undisputed top two players on the planet, combining for the last seven World Player of the Year honors and shattering goal records along the way.

With both still in their primes, they figure to be trading the Champions League all-time goal record for the coming years. Each tied and passed former Real Madrid starand current New York Cosmos strikerRaul's mark of 71 this season, and have a head-to-head battle on their hands (or on their extremely gifted feet). Barcelona and Real Madrid each made the Champions League quarterfinals, which means each has at least two more games this season to add to his total, and even more if the clubs advance.

We'll be tracking their Champions League progress from here on out. Scroll over the timeline below to watch each players' historic goals, doing so with the knowledge that next closest active player to both of them is 37-year-old Chelsea forward Didier Drogba...with 44.
