NEW YORK (AP) Mrs McDougal impressively won the $72,000 allowance feature for fillies and mares at Aqueduct on Friday, pulling away to a 7 1/4-length win.

The 3-year-old faced older runners for the first time, and shrugged off the challenge. Mrs McDougal set the pace under early pressure and kicked away from the pack turning for home to earn her second win in three starts.

Irad Ortiz Jr. was aboard for the mile in 1:39.07 over the turf course labeled good. The 9/5 favorite trained by Chad Brown paid $5.60, $3.70 and $3.

Chrysolite rallied to get second, returning $11.40 and $5.10. Jet Majesty paid $4.30 to show.
