Duke's Quinn Cook is a J. Cole impersonator
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Quinn Cook is hoping to join the NBA after finishing his senior season at Duke, but in case those plans don't work out, he is also working on a side career as a J. Cole impersonator.

Former Duke player Nolan Smith recently posted video of himself at a mall talking to some women who believed he was the North Carolina-based rapper and singer.

Cook even attempts to sing a bit of Cole's hit "Apparently" for the ladies, but cuts himself off before his ruse is discovered.
