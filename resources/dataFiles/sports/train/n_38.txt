Max Kruses last-minute score handed the Foals the 1-0 result, and Wolfsburgs aims of contesting the top spot ended abruptly.

In second place with 61 points, Wolfsburg is now fifteen points behind Bayern, while Monchengladbach is currently nineteen points back with the victory.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is more than happy with his crews status.

Per BBC Sport:

Retaining the title is a magnificent achievement. All credit to the coach and the team. Theyve been fantastic throughout, in a season following a World Cup where we had a host of players in action

Well have a magnificent party at some stage, no worries. But all in good time. When we do, itll be a huge celebration.
