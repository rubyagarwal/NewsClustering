Video: Wild chase Allen following two soft goals
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Jake Allen didnt have the kind of start one would expect with his team on the brink of elimination.

Allen gave up a shorthanded marker to Zach Parise at 7:14 of the first period from a horrible angle.

The young guy is learning, we got to stick with him, Ken Hitchcock told Brian Engblom during a stoppage in play.

It didnt take long for Hitchcock to change his mind.

At 11:19 of the second, Justin Fontaine beat Allen five-hole on a shot he shouldve had.

Hitchcock had seen in enough replacing Allen with Brian Elliott.

Jake Allen will learn from this experience but he picked a bad time to get leaky. But bottom line, where are your "best players?" #stlblues  Lou Korac (@lkorac10) April 26, 2015

Elliott has not played in the series with his last appearance coming on April 11.

Allen allowed two goals on 13 shots.

Elliotts last playoff action came during the lockout-shortened 2012-13 when the Blues lost in six games of the first round to the L.A. Kings.
