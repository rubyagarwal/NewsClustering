LONDON (AP) Cycling's governing body will try out mixed-gender track races in response to calls from Olympic leaders to increase female participation.

Encouraging more mixed events is part of International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach's ''Olympic Agenda 2020'' reform package.

Although cycling has no tradition of such events, UCI President Brian Cookson says ''we have got to think of creative ways of making that work in the special circumstances of our particular sport.''

Cookson says the International Cycling Union will ''try some mixed events and see what works and doesn't work ... we've got to be open minded.''

The trials will take place behind closed doors on Friday at the UCI's velodrome in Switzerland.

Cookson spoke at the Sport Industry Breakfast Club in London
