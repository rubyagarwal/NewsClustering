Video: Parise opens scoring from a bad angle
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
With Justin Fontaine in the box for tripping, Zach Parise opened the scoring with his second of the playoffs.

Matt Cooke started the play by causing Kevin Shattenkirk to turn the puck over at the Wild blue line.

Parise then beat Blues starter Jake Allen from a bad angle.

It makes one wonder

What is Jake Allen doing there? #stlblues  Lou Korac (@lkorac10) April 26, 2015

Parise is the sixth player in franchise history to score a shorthanded goal in the playoffs.

Minnesota is 2-0 in the series when scoring first.
