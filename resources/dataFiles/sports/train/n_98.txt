Lydia Ko Has Dominated Like Tiger Woods Did as a Teen
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Lydia Ko, who turns 18 on April 24, has had quite the start to her LPGA career. Sure, there have been other young, female stars to storm onto the scene as well  Michelle Wie and Lexi Thompson are easy choices  but Kos accomplishments havent been matched by anyone.

She became the number one female golfer in the world as a teenager and was the youngest male or female to be named number one since some guy named Tiger Woodsand Ko did it nearly four years sooner.

The last female golfer to garner as much attention as Ko has at a young age was Wie, but Wie never won once in her 40 LPGA events before turning 18 despite netting 13 top-10s. Ko has won six times. Shes also picked up 28 top-10s in 49 events. Oh, and she has yet to miss a cut.

So while Wie and others cashed in off the course as teenagers (Wie signed lucrative deals with Nike and Sony at 15), no golfer has had as much on-course success since Tiger dominated as a youngster. How does Ko stack up against Tiger when comparing what they did before turning 18? Things have changed quite a bit since then, and the womens game is different than the mens, but still, numbers prove Ko is in a league or her own.

And, like Tiger showed us, Ko should have a lot to look forward to.
