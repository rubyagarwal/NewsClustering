Dallas Mavericks fans feel the team's mid-season blockbuster trade for Rajon Rondo may not have been a very wise move with coach Rick Carlisle saying he does not expect the mercurial point guard to play another game for the team after suffering a back injury.

Obviously fans are unhappy with Rondo, who has averaged 9.3 points, 6.5 assists, and 4.5 rebounds a game since joining the team from Boston, and one fan has put his distaste for the benched Maverick into song.

SBNation reports that J. Paul Slavens debuted "Rajon Rondo is the Worst" on Wednesday night at Live Oak Music Hall in Fort Worth, Texas, and it is pretty impressive, for a song about hating a basketball player.

Back when the team first acquired Rondo, fans were singing a very different tune, as the former Celtics point guard inspired a glowing parody of Taylor Swift's hit "Blank Space" back in December.
