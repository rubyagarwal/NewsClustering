NEW YORK (AP) Heavily favored Consumer Credit held on to beat Pine Needles by a neck Thursday in the $98,000 Memories of Silver Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Aqueduct.

Never far off the pace, Consumer Credit opened a 1 1/2-length advantage at the top of stretch before drifting outward in the late stages as Pine Needles kept trimming the lead. The 1-2 shot prevailed, paying $3, $2.10 and $2.10.

Irad Ortiz Jr. rode for trainer Chad Brown as Consumer Credit ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:48.56 over the yielding turf course for her fourth win in seven starts.

Pine Needles, the 5-2 second choice, returned $2.70 and $2.40. Kawfee Fa Marfa paid $3.80 to show.
