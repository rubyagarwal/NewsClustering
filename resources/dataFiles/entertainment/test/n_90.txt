Barack Obama got in plenty of jabs of his own at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner, but for the real digs, he called his "Anger Translator," Luther!

Key & Peele fans recognized ol' Luther right away as Keegan-Michael Key. Those unfamiliar with this bit quickly saw why the president called in the professional: An "Anger Translator" can say all the things Barack wishes he could!

At a certain point, though, the POTUS no longer needed backup. He hilariously overreacted all on his own, until Luther himself intervened, saying, "All due respect, sir, you don't need an anger translator! You need counseling!"

Of course, Barack had no trouble expressing his thoughts sans Luther. Like, for example, when he zinged his political predecessors, quipping, "Dick Cheney says he thinks I'm the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime. What a coincidence!"

He joked about his increasingly own gray hair, too, but he was the first to admit that while he was looking older and older, wife Michelle Obama "hasn't aged a day!"

The first lady, who debuted a new, curly 'do Saturday night, credits her youthful glow to, "Fresh fruits and vegetables," her hubby mocked playfully, adding with a smile, "It's aggravating!"

Barack got some laughs talking about Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential campaign, saying, "I have one friend, just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year, and she's now living out of a van in Iowa!"

He also got some giggles mocking a certain state's anti-gay laws. "Joe Biden is a great friend," he said. "We've gotten so close in some places in Indiana they won't serve us pizza anymore!"

There weren't too many jokes that fell flat, but host Cecily Strong still thought it might be about time for Barack to leave the party. "You're like Madonna," she told him. "You've both given this country so much, but in like a year-and-a-half, you've gotta stop."
