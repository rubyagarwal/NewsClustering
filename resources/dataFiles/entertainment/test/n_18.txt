It's only been one day since Universal Studios announced the two upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey sequels and we're already getting our first look at Fifty Shades Darker!

In the first pic from the upcoming sequel, Jamie Dornan channels Christian Grey in a black and white tux with a kinky facemask on. The 32-year-old Irish actor looks smoldering and super sexy as he stares at himself in the mirror in his apartment. We can only imagine the sizzling S&M antics Mr. Grey is about to get into!

The hot new black and white still is part of the promotion for the upcoming Blu-ray release of Fifty Shades of Grey, which hits stores on May 8.

Just yesterday, Universal announced that Fifty Shades Darker is set to hit theaters on Feb. 10, 2017. But that's not all. The studio also announced the release date for Fifty Shades Freed, the third installment in the franchise: Feb. 9, 2018.

The new movie still comes on the heels of news that the sequel will be written by E.L. James' husband Niall Leonard. It was previously revealed that Sam Taylor-Johnson will not return to direct the next sex flick.
