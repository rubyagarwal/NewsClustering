The 2015 Radio Disney Music Awards were held Saturday night at Nokia Theatre L.A. Live in Los Angeles where dozens of Disney stars and pop princesses were celebrated for their work on the music scene.

Hosted by Zendaya, the family-friend show included performances by Fifth Harmony, Becky G, Tori Kelly and countless others. The night also featured some A+ fashion with winning looks from Jennifer Lopez and Rumer Willis.

Oh, and did we mention Nick Jonas was also in attendance with girlfriend Olivia Culpo? Hot couple alert!

In all fairness, the show doesn't air until Sunday night at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Disney Channel. But if you can't wait a minute longer to see who showed up and who won big, we've got you covered!
