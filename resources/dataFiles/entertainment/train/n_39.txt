Sorry, wrong DC superhero, but you can forgive our confusion at the moment since our favorite Arrow hero is turning into a scary villain. After Oliver's (Stephen Amell) totally hot and intimate hookup with Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) on the last episode of the CW's superhero drama, he said his goodbyes to his friends and loved ones and took his place as Al Sah-Him, Heir to the Demon, in the League of Assassins.

It was dark. It was intense. And it was totally. Freakin'. Awesome.

But in order to fully accept his new position, he had to shed his old life. That's right, Oliver Queen and the Arrow are no more, and so his old green hood that's been with him since his early days on the island with Yao Fei (Byron Mann) has been replaced with a costume that is more suited for this darker path.
