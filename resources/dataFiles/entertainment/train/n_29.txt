HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Kelly Bensimon has been known to turn a few heads. After all, who can forget Bethenny Frankel's reaction to seeing the model on last week's Real Housewives of New York City.

But on Saturday afternoon in the middle of the Big Apple, the Bravolebrity took part in an extra risqu photo shoot that resulted in more than one nip slip.

Wearing a completely sheer blouse, the 46-year-old showed off her assets from the front on numerous occasions while photographers snapped away. And no, her white blazer was not exactly shielding her from any revealing moments.

The mother of two completed her look with dark denim skinny jeans and a silver clutch before changing into other outfits.

As it turns out, this isn't the first time the fashion blogger has had some malfunctions with her ensembles. During a recent trip to Miami, Bensimon tried to enjoy a dip in the ocean blue water before realizing her bathing suit top was exposing a little too much. Oops!

Ever since leaving the Real Housewives of New York City full-time after season four, Bensimon has developed a lifestyle website centered around style, travel and home dcor.

And instead of reliving Scary Island and not-so-glamourous moments from the show, the reality star focuses on the positive. After all, her tagline was "I'm living the American Dream, one mistake at a time."

"I have passion and follow through," Bensimon told one follower. "Therefore im happy :)"
