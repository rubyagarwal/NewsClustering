HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Just hours after learning that ex-boyfriend Dan Fredinburg had died in a Mount Everest Avalanche, the actress attended the 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington, D.C.

Although the 32-year-old Chicago P.D. star looked as lovely as ever in an emerald green gown, she was undoubtedly still in mourning following the tragic loss of the 33-year-old Google executive, a man she described as "one of the great loves of my life."

In a heartfelt Instagram post earlier that day, Sophia remembered Dan as "one-of-a-kind. Fearless. FunnyHe was one of my favorite human beings on Earth."

The actress and Dan dated in 2013 before calling it quits in February 2014. The exes clearly remained friends after the split, though, because as Sophia revealed Saturday, she had plans to catch up with Dan after his trek. "I was looking forward to our planned download of 'all the things' when he got home," she wrote. "I am crushed that I will never hear that story."

"Please remember that our time on this Earth is not guaranteed," she continued. "Please tell those you love that you do. Right now. This very minute. And please send a kiss to the sky for my friend Dan. His energy is so big and so bright, and it's all around us, so put some love toward him today. And then hug your loved ones again."

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Sophia and all of Dan's friends, family and loved ones.
