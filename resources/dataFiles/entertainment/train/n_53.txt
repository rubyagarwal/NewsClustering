Kimora Lee Simmons has shared the first photo of her infant son Wolfe Lee, taking to Instagram a week or so after his birth to introduce him to the world.

"#WolfeLee is finally here!" the fashion mogul and TV personality captioned the pic, which doesn't show her baby boy's full face, but does draw attention to his impressive head of hair. Mom, meanwhile, is understandably bare-faced and aglow simply with contentment.

"After an intimate, beautiful, long birth! He's everything we thought he would be and MORE!" Simmons continues. "I am so grateful to my amazing husband for all of his support and love through it all. He never left my side! It wasn't easy, but we did it! Thank you also to my special 'nurse Maureen' and team that helped me get thru this! #Whoa #Wolfe #BabyWolfe #SkinToSkin #MotherOfFour."

If she wants this pic to trend, she isn't messing around.

Wolfe Lee is Simmons' first child with banker husband Tim Leissner and, as she noted, her fourth overall. She's also mom to daughters Ming and Aoki with ex-husband Russell Simmons and has a son, Kenzo, with actor Djimon Hounsou.
