Colin Farrell may be single, but he's not exactly ready to mingle.

In a new interview with The Sunday Times, the 38-year-old actor is opening up about his life as a father. And along the way, he's setting the record straight about his dating life.

"I have not dated for, ooh, four years now. It's just not happening, what with the work, the kids and my life," he told the U.K. publication. "I know it's not what people expect to hear, but that's the honest truth."

So what's really holding him back? These days, the Golden Globe winner would rather spend quality time with his two sons who he loves with all of his heart.

"It's not all about you anymore, which is a relief," Farrell explained. "It's about a bigger world, and helping them find their place in it."

He continued, "It's not about me, me, me, the loudmouth' any moreand that takes the pressure off me to live up to those old expectations." Farrell is the proud dad to son James, 11, and Henry, 5.

His latest interview is just another sign that the actor is nowhere close to those "wild years" in Hollywood that featured plenty of rumored romances in the tabloids and late nights out on the town.

Today, Farrell is excited to star alongside Vince Vaughn in True Detective season two where he will play a "compromised detective" in the industrial City of Vinci in Los Angeles County.

While the role is quite the big deal in the world of Hollywood, Farrell knows that it's his kids at home that mean the most.
