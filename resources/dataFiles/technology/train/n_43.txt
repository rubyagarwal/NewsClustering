If you're looking to upgrade your car, look no further than the New York Auto Show, which has invaded the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan with some of the most dazzling and buzzed-about cars in tow.

Of course, many of these vehicles are just slightly out of most people's price ranges, but that's what makes the show so intriguing. Ford and Kia share the same floor space as Rolls Royce and Maserati.

We hit the show floor this weekend to find some of the hottest cars on display. Some look more futuristic and impressive than others, but all have been making headlines. The show runs until April 12, and is open to the public for $16 per adult. But if you can't make it to New York, check out the slideshow for the most show-stopping cars on offer.
