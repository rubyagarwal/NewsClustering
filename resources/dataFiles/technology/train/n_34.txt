When Steve Jobs introduced the world to the "magical" world of modern touch-screen tablets in 2010, he surely didn't have Datawind's $38 Ubislate 7Ci in mind.

This 7Ci is the inevitable endpoint in the evolution of any gadget: Phase 1) an exciting new gadget is introduced at a premium price; Phase 2) the technology and price are improved upon by competing high-end manufacturers; and finally some years down the road, Phase 3) no-name manufacturers cut every corner there is until they can create a no-frills device affordable to every member of the economic spectrum.

If you've ever operated an iPad, you'll be fantastically disappointed by the 7Ci.

The Android tab has just enough oomph to cover the digital basics: Wi-Fi Internet access, lo-fi communication, and a basic app ecosystem. You wouldn't use this to catch up on Girls on HBO GO.

While you wouldn't want to waste a $400 iPad as a wall clock, you wouldn't really think about it for a $38 7Ci.
