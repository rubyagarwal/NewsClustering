Twenty-five years ago today, the Hubble Space Telescope launched aboard the Discovery space shuttle, zooming into space to provide us with an "unobstructed view of the universe."

At launch, Hubble carried a Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectograph (GHRS), Faint Object Camera (FOC), Faint Object Spectograph (FOS), and High Speed Photometer (HSP). But scientists noticed that initial photographs were rather blurry, prompting a 1993 service mission that included a record five back-to-back spacewalks. That mission was successful and soon "began returning sharp and spectacular images," according to NASA.

Subsequent missions have improved Hubble's photography skills even morea 1997 update allowed it to detect infrared light from deep-space objects and take detailed photos of celestial objects, for example. Now, the Hubble image gallery includes dozens and dozens of mind-boggling photos that are so spectacular that you might question whether they are actually real. As of last year, Hubble had snapped more than 570,000 images of 30,000 celestial objects since 1990; it now generates about 3-4GB of data each day.

Hubble races around Earth at 17,500 mph, finishing one complete spin in 97 minutes. It sends back information that lets scientists observe the most distant stars and galaxies as well as the planets in our solar system. But it also provides the average space fan with a peek "above the distortion of the atmosphere, [and] far, far above rain clouds and light pollution." It's worth your time to peruse the full Hubble gallery, but for a quick fix, here are 11 images that caught our eye.
