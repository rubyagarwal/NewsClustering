Xiaomi is all set to bring in another variant of its flagship, Mi 4, it will be known as Mi 4i. The Chinese giant has already rolled out the invitations for an upcoming Global smartphone event, which will be held in India, New Delhi on April 23rd.

The grapevine spills out that the company is going to unveil the Mi 4i in the very event itself. The new device is now going through the GFXBench benchmark test.



Even though Xiaomi is calling it a Global event, but, it does not mean that the company has any plan to launch the device in U.S. or Europe any sooner. Interestingly, MI 4i will be Xiaomis first device that will be officially announced outside of China.

In accordance with the GFXBench benchmark test, the Mi 4i will come with a 4.9-inch display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. The device will be powered by a 1.6GHz hexa-core Snapdragon 615 CPU with Adreno 405 GPU and 2GB of RAM.

As for the performance numbers, its a mid-range phone, so theres not much to get excited about: 5.8FPS at the Manhattan test, and 14.6FPS for the old T-Rex test.

It might feature 16GB of internal storage, 13-megapixel rear camera along with a 5-megapixel front camera. It will support Dual SIM and 4G LTE connectivity and will run Android 5.0.2 with Xiaomis MIUI 6 skin on top.

The device is expected to come for a price of approximately $192 USD-$208 USD. Simply going by the looks of it, it is quite clear that the device has lower specs than the Mi 4.
