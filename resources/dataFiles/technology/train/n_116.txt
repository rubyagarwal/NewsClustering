Apple Watch Found To Be More Water-Resistant Than Advertised
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
The way the Apple Watch has been designed and marketed, it certainly doesnt sound like your rugged watch or do the kind of things one might associate with a G-Shock. However the device does have some measure of protection and has been certified as IPX7 meaning that it is water-resistant up to 1 meter and for a maximum duration of 30 minutes.

However it is possible that Apple might be underplayed its water-resistance, you know, for legal purposes. That being said, the folks at FoneFox from Australia have decided to put the wearable to the test and to see if it is truly IPX7 as advertised. As it turns out, the device proved to be more resistant that we had previously thought.

What they did was they first took the watch for a light shower, followed by a real shower including soap to mimic everyday life. They then submerged the watch in a bucket of water for 5 minutes, and then took it for a swim where they left it underwater for 15 minutes. If you think that the watch would have been damaged along the way, think again.

Surprising there was no visible or lasting damage. The watch continued to function as per normal so the takeaway here is that if you were worried that the Apple Watch might be a bit too dainty for more active use, hopefully this video will convince you otherwise.
