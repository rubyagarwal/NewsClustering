Bungie Details Destiny Iron Banner 2.0
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
As part of its weekly update blog post Bungie has detailed Iron Banner 2.0. The developer writes that in Iron Banner 2.0 Lord Saladin will be making a return to the Tower, and that his reappearance is intentional. Saladin was sent packing after a surprise ambush during what was supposed to be his sabbatical. The developer needed more time to work and bring up his new potential.

Bungie did some of that work during a planned maintenance session this week. If the upcoming Destiny Updates stick to their timeline, Lord Saladins altar of war and glory will be accessible once again.

Some changes have also been made to the Iron Banner requirements. Only players Level 20 and above will be able to lead a Fireteam, but players below Level 20 will be able to join the fun as well with powerful friends.

While players will see that their previous Iron Banner rank has been preserved, Lord Saladin will now have five ranks to obtain through victory. Players can increase their rank to unlock better gear, earn boots and gauntlets to move closer to Level 30 and reforge weapons to reset progression with new perks.

Players reputation will be reset at the conclusion of this Iron Banner. Bungie will provide a 24 hour advance notice before this competitive activity kicks off.

Bungie will also be delivering a new feature in beta which is voice channel shared by players that meet through Matchmaking. The list of all improvements coming in this update, including those to Iron Banner 2.0, are described in detail on Bungies blog.
