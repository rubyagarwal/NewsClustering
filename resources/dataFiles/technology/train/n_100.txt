Multiple carriers in the United States have released the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for Galaxy Note 4 but T-Mobile is not one of them. A couple of weeks back we reported when the carrier started testing said update for this device and now we have information about when its going to be released. T-Mobile is going to release the Lollipop update for Galaxy Note 4 starting next week.

Carriers like AT&T and Sprint have already released the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for this device so its about time that T-Mobile got in on the game as well. The testing has been concluded and this update is now ready to be rolled out for Magenta subscribers.

The word comes straight from Des Smith who is a senior product manager at T-Mobile. Smith says that the carrier has received technical acceptance for the Note 4 Lollipop update which is why it can now start rolling out the update from next week.

Galaxy Note 4 owners on T-Mobile should now expected to see an update notification pop up on their device in the very near future. They will then finally join the ranks of users who have already got a taste of Lollipop on their Note 4 units.

Android 5.0 Lollipop is going to bring a handful of new features of the device as well as user interface improvements.
