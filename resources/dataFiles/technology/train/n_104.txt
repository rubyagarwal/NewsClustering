HEADLINE_ARTICLE
This time around LG decided not to unveil its new flagship smartphone at Mobile World Congress 2015 and wait almost two months to conduct an event of its own. LG has scheduled an event on April 28th where its going to unveil the LG G4 smartphone. Following tradition the company has decided to these features were most likely to see in its upcoming flagship, like the 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Today it has released a video teasing the LG G4 user interface.

The video is about LGs UX 4.0 to be precise, thats the custom skin that LG will slap on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It goes without saying that the G4 will be among the first few devices that get LG UX 4.0 first.

LGs video teaser gives us an idea of what the software might look like on the companys upcoming flagship smartphone. It even details features like Quick Shot which lets users take a picture by double tapping the volume button without even having to wake up the phone.

Other features include Smart Board which basically collects and displays information from multiple sources such as music, health and calendar apps. Theres even an expert mode in the camera app that will provide users with advanced controls.

During the teaser we dont get a glimpse of the LG G4 itself, its too much to expect anyway, since LG will be unveiling the device on April 28th it wont quite make sense to unveil the device to the public at this point in time.
