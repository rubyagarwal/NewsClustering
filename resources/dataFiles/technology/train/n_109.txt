Sony Xperia Z4 Only For Japan, Another Flagship Will Be Incoming
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Yesterday Sony unveiled the Xperia Z4 which many had assumed would be the companys flagship handset, but oddly enough the phone was launched without much fanfare, not to mention it was launched in Japan which is an odd choice as Sonys previous flagship announcements were targeted at the international audience.

However as it turns out, it seems that Sony might have different plans for the rest of the world. According to a report from Hi-tech.mail.ru (via PhoneArena), it seems that the Xperia Z4 is only aimed at the Japanese market, and that Sony has another flagship planned for other markets around the world which they are planning on announcing towards the end of May.

If anything this rumor makes sense and would corroborate earlier claims that Sonys next flagship could sport an all-metal body and a fingerprint sensor (as opposed to the metal band used in the Xperia Z4). It would also corroborate an earlier rumor that mentioned the Xperia Z5 which would pack specs that we thought the Xperia Z4 would come with, such as a QHD display.

Of course it should all be taken with a grain of salt for now, but in case you were a little disappointed by the Xperia Z4, there is now a chance that Sony might have more up their sleeves than we previously thought.
