Largest Silent Hill Collection In The World
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
In June this year, we saw the worlds largest video game collection being put up for sale, before it was snapped up for a cool three quarters of a million dollars not too long after. Well, there are different categories of records to vie for in the world of video games, which is why a certain Whitney Chavis is proud to have been certified by the Guinness World Records. Chavis has been cited to be owner of the Largest Silent Hill Collection, where it is made up of a whopping 342 pieces of Silent Hill memorabilia.

Chavis must have left no stone unturned, as there is no statuette, tchotchke, or Silent Hill swag that has escaped her notice close to the past one and a half decades. Chavis shared, I got into the series way back when the first game was released in the U.S. My interest was piqued when I read a short preview of the game accompanied by a screenshot of Harry standing over dead dog in a bloodied alley in one of my brothers random game magazines. After beating the game once I had so many questions left over that I knew replaying and getting all the endings was a must.

Chavis also happens to maintain the Silent Hill Historical Society, and if you are curious to see what this world record is like, do check out the 12-minute video below. [Press Release]
