We were intrigued by the Amphibious 1000's proposed floating suites and private underwater lounges, however The Conrad Maldives Rangali Island Resort hosts the real deal! Situated in the tropical gardens on Rangalifinolhu Island, access to the resort is only by seaplane and while it may sound like any other exclusive get away, the Conrad Rangali will have you dining with stingrays and on special occasions, sleeping with the sharks.

Opening its doors a little over five years ago, the resort features the world's first all-glass, under-the-sea restaurant. Guests are offered the experience of dining 16 feet (4.9 m) below sea level with 180-degree views of the reef and marine life. The resort has also been known to transform the underwater dining room into a private bedroom suite for two on special occasions.

Nestled away on two private islands and surrounded by white-sandy beaches, the hotel boasts 50 water villas, 79 beach villas and 21 spa villas with private treatment rooms. Spa treatments are also available in glass-floored rooms situated above the lagoon's coral reef and outdoor activities include scuba diving, snorkeling safaris, windsurfing, game fishing, catamaran sailing and sunset cruising on the resort's yacht.

The Conrad Rangali has all the luxury resort trappings with ocean view baths, Philippe Starck fittings, private sun decks, espresso machines and Bulgari bathroom goodies. It's also definitely at the higher end of the market with guest rooms starting at US$815 per night, per couple. The underwater restaurant only seats 12 and guests are advised to book well in advance.
