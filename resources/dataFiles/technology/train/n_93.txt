WhatsApp For Android Voice Calling Accessible To All Now
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
It looks as though that the voice calling feature went live for some users of WhatsApp earlier this month, but even better news is this  that voice calling for WhatsApp is now available to every single user out there. Of course, not everyone will be able to take advantage of this unique feature just like that, since there are several loopholes to jump through in the first place. For instance, you will need to have the most recent version of WhatsApp installed on your device, and that would be version 2.11.531, although there are whispers of voice calling being supported on 2.11.528, too.

Apart from that, one is also required to have a smartphone or tablet that runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop or Android 4.4 KitKat as the mobile operating system of choice. Hence, should your mobile device be running on an older version of Android, you are out of luck  at least until the mobile operating system is updated, or you pick up a new device.

So far, word on the street has it that those who happen to be privileged enough to qualify to enjoy the voice calling feature will first need to send their contacts a missed call prior to obtaining this feature.
