Short for if this then that, IFTTT is a service that allows you to create triggers that can cause multiple apps to work together to produce a more complex effect when these triggers are activated  i.e. make cool things happen together in response to other things happening. For example: If you were to add a new photo on Instagram, you could configure the service so that these photos are also backed up to your Box online storage account upon being taken, or set weather alerts to be sent to your email every morning on wakeup. Alternately, you might arrange to automatically backup your personal contacts to an online spreadsheet at regular intervals, or share status updates made on one social network to another. Literally thousands of combinations are available  thankfully, so are a growing number of templates users have shared that you can quickly grab and utilize.Using IFTTT, youcan quickly set and configure high-tech rituals and routines that can make life that much more connected and simpler.
