<technology>##The Phantom Pain Gets Its Own PS4 Model
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
It is not unusual for Sony to link up with game developers to create special edition models of its console. This happens to be a great way to sell console + game bundles so its a win-win for both parties involved. Yesterday Konami finally confirmed the official release date of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. Today we find out that this title is getting its very own model of the PlayStation 4.

From the looks of it this color combination is quite appealing, making it one of the most beautiful PS4 models we have seen up till now, at least it comes close to holding a candle to the 20th Anniversary edition model of the PlayStation 4.

The color combination for this particular model is inspired from Snakes bionic arm. Diamond Dogs logos are emblazoned on both the console and the DualShock 4 controller.

A report out of Japan reveals that no pricing or availability information has been provided for this PlayStation 4 model as yet but we can expect it to arrive in the fall since Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain itself is scheduled for release on September 1st.

It is obviously not known at this point in time if and when this model will be released in other markets around the globe.
