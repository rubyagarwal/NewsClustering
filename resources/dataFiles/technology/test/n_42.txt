The Apple Watch officially launches today, though some buyers might be waiting until June to get their hands on one. We just got ours into the PC Labs, though, and have been busy setting it up and testing out its features.

After unboxing the new smartwatch, we linked it up to an iPhone 6, and started exploring. Apple products are usually quite intuitive, and the Apple Watch is no exception, but there is a bit of a learning curve since everything has to be displayed on a tiny screen.

Our slideshow features several videos that walk you through the basics of your Apple Watchfrom changing the watch face to customizing notifications and setting an alarm. Check them out, and let us know in the comments if there are any other features you'd like to see in action.

We'll be putting the Apple Watch through its paces this weekend, and will have a full review early next week. Until then, check out our tips, as well as our hands on with the smartwatch from last month's press event.
