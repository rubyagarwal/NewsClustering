You cant let the process numb you to the point where youre just a robot. Even though all the pressure is Dont gaffe, dont deviate, be prepared, give the prepared thing, youve got to watch that, because you can just be boring and you can be vanilla and you can so sanitize yourself that youre not yourself.

 Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), quoted by Politico, on running for national office.
