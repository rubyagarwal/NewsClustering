<politics>##George W. Bush Comments on 2016 Election
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Former President George W. Bush offered rare, and broad-ranging, remarks Saturday night about current national security threats and the 2016 presidential campaign to a large audience of Jewish donors, suggesting that sanctions on Iran should not be lifted, that his last name was a burden to his brother, the likely presidential candidate Jeb Bush, and that Hillary Rodham Clinton, while formidable, was beatable, the New York Times reports.

He spoke dismissively of candidates who surrounded themselves with sycophants and bemoaned a culture built around a single person, or even a party. The goal, he stressed, should be about serving the national interest.
