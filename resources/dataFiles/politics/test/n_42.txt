I am not aware of any body of atheists who seek to criminalize theism. Pisher says extremists and so presumably he can point to at least two, but to pretend that theres any significance in it is  at best  a red herring.

And to say that the growing body of historical research suggests there was no historical person called Jesus is also sophistry  unless by no person you mean no person who did and said all that was attributed to him in the Bible. If its the latter definition, well duh!  its a straw man to go with the red herring. And if the evidence is, in fact, the lack of contemporaneous records, well duh! again: all the arguments about who Jesus was or whether he existed at all are ultimately based on probabilities and the subjective assignment of weights to those probabilities.
