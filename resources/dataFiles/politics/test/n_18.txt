<politics>##George W. Bush Comments on 2016 Election
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
First, Bushs road map for peace between Israel and the Palestinians was identical to the position of the Obama administration. The Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was also encouraged by Bush along with the subsequent elections in Gaza that led to the rise of Hamas.

And, of course, Bushs Iraq war, which was supported by Netanyahu and Jewish Republicans, vastly strengthened Iran in the region. Irans nuclear capability increased exponentially during the Bush years, and it was President Obama who strengthened sanctions and brought Russia and China on board. The proposed nuclear deal with Iran, which Republicans have attempted to scuttle with acts bordering on treason, may be the only chance to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Jewish donors attending this event are delusional in thinking that Republican policies are beneficial for Israel and that Republicans are, in any way, friends of the Jewish people. Thankfully, a majority of Jews understand this.
