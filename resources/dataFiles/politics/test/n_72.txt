<politics>##G.O.P. Struggling With Shifts on Gay Marriage
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Rick Santorum said he would never attend a same-sex wedding. Marco Rubio said he might attend one. Scott Walker actually went to a same-sex wedding reception, not to be confused with an actual same-sex wedding ceremony. Ted Cruz said he is firmly opposed to gay marriage, but would be comfortable if his daughter were gay.

Republican presidential candidates are struggling to adjust to a rapidly changing legal, political and cultural landscape this primary season, as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments Tuesday on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutionally protected right.

Once a winning primary issue as well as a powerful wedge issue wielded against Democrats, opposing same-sex marriage has grown far more complicated for Republicans. While it could offer conservative candidates a way to break through a crowded primary field, it looms as a liability with general election voters, particularly independent ones, who are more supportive of same-sex marriage than more conservative Republicans.

The country has moved decidedly in the direction of gay unions, said Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma and an opponent of same-sex marriage. That doesnt mean those of us who have always been of the view that marriage is between a man and a woman will not be heard. Its just that things have changed, and this is an issue that has changed the dynamics of the conversation.

For all the skirmishing over questions about attending ceremonies, the field of declared and presumed Republican candidates is united in opposing same-sex marriages. The only difference among them is the extent they will choose to emphasize the issue through the coming year. And given the fast pace of politics, what is a resonant issue today may well not be in November 2016.

Many Republicans said they were hopeful that the Supreme Courts decision on same-sex unions would not be the subject of prolonged debate beyond the initial burst of positioning.

Most of them understand the legal reality of the situation and will emphasize other issues during the campaign, including their plans to nominate conservative Supreme Court justices, said Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.

But moving forward may not be easy. For one thing, the more conservative members of this Republican field  among them Mr. Cruz, a senator from Texas; Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania; Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana; and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas  have aggressively emphasized their opposition to same-sex marriage. For them, the issue can be used to differentiate themselves not just from Democrats but from mainstream Republicans, like Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, who is trying to appeal to a broader audience with an eye to the general election.

For them, any court decision in favor of marriage  combined with a push by state Republicans to pass laws that protect religious merchants from being forced to provide services to same-sex weddings  is an opportunity to break through to the sizable conservative wing of the electorate and potentially eclipse candidates like Mr. Bush.

At a forum before evangelical Christians in Waukee, Iowa, on Saturday, the Republican candidates told a cheering crowd that the fight over same-sex marriage would not end with a Supreme Court decision.

Mr. Cruz said advocates of traditional marriage should fall to our knees and pray against a court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Mr. Jindal was critical of Republican lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas who backed down on laws that proponents say protect religious freedom, while Mr. Rubio declared that the institution of marriage as one man and one woman existed long before our laws existed.

The pressure will come from outside the field as well. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group, said same-sex marriage opponents would again demand, as they did with overwhelming success in 2012, that Republican presidential candidates sign a pledge of support for a federal marriage amendment to the Constitution. The court is not the final say on the issue, Mr. Perkins said.

Democrats, dispelling what had once been their own political qualms about same-sex marriage, have made clear they will seize on it this time. I think its impossible for them to walk away from it, said Joel Benenson, the pollster for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. This is a values issue where the Republicans have been on the wrong side of America for the last six years. And irrespective of the decision, thats going to remain problematic for them.

Support for same-sex marriage is increasing across the board; I dont think there is any other social issue or values issue that has moved as fast as gay marriage, said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, who has been counseling his party to adapt to changing times. Views on it are changing much more sharply among independents and Democrats, however, than among Republicans.

Support for same-sex marriage is increasing among Republican voters, but it is still a minority view. That creates a split between conservative Republicans looking to win a primary, and candidates seeking to win a primary without carrying too much baggage into a general election.

If the Supreme Court affirms same-sex marriage, the prospect that a Republican presidential candidate would champion the opposition to those unions is a matter of concern for Republican strategists, as the party seeks to take back the White House for the first time in eight years.

This is an issue that is being decided by demography every single day  59 percent of Americans support marriage equality, including 52 percent of Republicans under 50 and more than 60 percent of evangelicals under 30  and also by human experience, said Ken Mehlman, a businessman who came out as gay after serving as the Republican national chairman. When people see couples who have married, they see love, they see more stability, they see more commitment and they see more compassionate care for people who are old and are sick and more stable homes where children are being raised.

Mr. Bolger said that even if the court ended up not finding in favor same-sex marriage, the sweep of change would continue. Given the generation gap on this issue, even if the courts rule against same-sex marriage, its only going to be a matter of time before this changes: Opponents of same-sex marriage are dying a lot faster than supporters are because opponents are older, he said.

During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Bolger said, he thought same-sex marriage would fade as an issue. Still, he said, a key question is whether independent voters, who strongly support same-sex marriage, end up considering its importance when the time comes to vote.

Independents are the vanguard  they are the tip of the spear on this, he said. This is one of those issues where independents look more like Democrats. Its one of the few issues where they do.

Gregory T. Angelo, the executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of gay Republicans, said he did not think a Republican who backed same-sex marriage was necessarily doomed. That said, Mr. Angelo said a court decision affirming same-sex marriage would settle the issue and provide an escape route for the party.

They would be doing the Republican presidential field an incredible favor by giving them the potential gift of moving this as a hot-button cultural issue more than a year out from Election Day, he said of the Supreme Court justices. Ultimately it is up to Republican and individual candidates to determine whether or not they want to continue a culture war that they are on the losing end of.
