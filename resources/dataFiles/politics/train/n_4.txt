Polis Proposes Restrain Steve King from Legislating Act
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
On the heels of Rep. Steve Kings outrageous announcement Wednesday of his Restrain the Judges on Marriage Act, Rep. Jared Polis (CO-02) today proposed the Restrain Steve King from Legislating Act. The bill would prevent Steve King from abusing taxpayer dollars by substituting the judgments of the nations duly serving judicial branch of government with his own beliefs.

For too long, Steve King has overstepped his constitutionally nonexistent judicial authority, Polis said. Mr. King has perverted the Constitution to create rights to things such as discrimination, bullying, and disparate treatment. These efforts to enshrine these appalling values as constitutional rights were not envisioned by the voters, or by Kings colleagues who must currently try to restrain his attempts to single-handedly rewrite the nations founding principles on a bill-by-bill basis.

I urge the House to bring this bill to the floor. If passed, my bill would preserve the right of millions of voters in all 50 states who would prefer that Steve King refrain from legislating a role for himself in their marriage decisions.

Wednesdays announcement is the latest in a long string of offensive and inflammatory legislation and comments Steve King has authored. Earlier this year, citing a need to end the anchor baby agenda, King reintroduced (for the third time) legislation that would end birthright citizenship. He is also infamous for saying that undocumented immigrants had calves the size of cantaloupes because they were smuggling drugs.
