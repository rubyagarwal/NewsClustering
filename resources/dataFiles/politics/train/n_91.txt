This audio is not currently available.

Welcome to ThistleRadio, a 24/7 channel devoted to music from Celtic roots. In more than three decades hosting The Thistle & Shamrock, I've listened to thousands of albums. For ThistleRadio, I reach into my music archive to hand-pick songs and instrumentals by passionate performers from across the decades.

Fresh from the mailbox, I'll introduce artists from a rising tide of modern talent, as well as bring you new music from the greats. The playlist is growing fast, so tune in and see where the music takes you. You can also listen to ThistleRadio in the NPR Music iPhone and iPad apps.
