Ta-ku is that dude on SoundCloud. Over the past few years, the Australian producer has established himself as one of the frontrunners in the musical playground of remix kings and percussive trap. Days after dropping a Flume re-remix that fits neatly into that universe, he flips the script with "Love Again," the first single from his upcoming EP, Songs To Make Up To. The new project is a companion piece to his 2013 breakout Songs To Break Up To, which embodied the disjointed, uncomfortable acceptance of love lost.

"Love Again" feels a world away. It's compositionally spiritual, with piano chords that would be equally suited for an organ, and flashes of lyrics that could ring true in church pews. Whichever way you read the lyrics, Detroit singer JMSN's vocals feel like a hand outstretched, an acknowledgment of the trials of the past, and an invitation to move toward a better future: "Give it time, give it time / This ain't no race."

Soulection  a collective of progressive beatmakers and a dominant force of SoundCloud  lends one of its most prominent producers to the track: Sango. While he hasn't pigeonholed himself as a gospel musician, he's a vocal Christian and allows his faith to cross over into his music, with tracks like the moving "JMK" (Jesus My King). His presence here makes sense without being overt, as he comes in with a kick to the chest in the final minute.

Songs To Make Up To is out June 12 on Fool's Gold / Future Classic.
