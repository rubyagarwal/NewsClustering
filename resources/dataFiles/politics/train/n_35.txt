Williams Embellished Reporting At Least 11 Times
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Bottom line is that public figures are held to a higher standard that non-public figures. Williams wasnt just an anchorhe was the managing editor of the newswhich means he got to decide what was reported and how. And thats why NBC is dealing with this so harshly. Once you lose credibility, regardless of the reason, it seeps into every aspect of your job. And if your job is the news, you cant just separate it from your personal weaknesses. If he was a drug addict, would that impact how he reported stories or documentaries he did on drugs? The fact that the question would even be asked is the problem that his personal drug use would create. Does this go on with other people other than Williams? Most likely so. And if they were to be found out as well, then youll see the same reaction.
