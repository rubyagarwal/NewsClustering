Bonus Quote of the Day

I have proposed a new rule to allow school districts to install deep fat fryers and sell beverages like diet soda. I believe each school district  not the state or federal government  should decide what foods are offered to students If a school district doesnt agree with any of these changes, then the district doesnt have to implement them. Thats the beauty here. Its not about French fries; its about freedom.

 Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, in a letter to the Houston Chronicle.
