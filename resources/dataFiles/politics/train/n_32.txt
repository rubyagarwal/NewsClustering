Clinton Campaign Faces Early Test

More importantly, from a post on Dave Leips Atlas Forum

If you judge Hillary Clintons New Hampshire swing by the national headlines, it was a failure.

Two days out, the national press is writing about none of the Clinton campaigns favorite topics: not about her small-scale opening, not about her earnest efforts to listen to the concerns of everyday Americans, and not much about her New Hampshire trip at all. Instead, the political world is dissecting a New York Times story about donors to the Clinton Foundation getting approval from the Clinton-run State department to sell their uranium rights to Russiaand the national media is awaiting the Clinton Cash book that will continue in that vein.

But the national headlines were never the point.



The front page of Wednesdays Concord Monitor was headlined: In the Spotlight: Clinton attracts crowds, attention as she swings through city. And the week before, shed fared even better: Clinton vows shell help people get ahead, read the front page of the April 15 Des Moines Register. The Quad City Times was gentle as well: Clinton surprises LeClaire coffee shop.

Perhaps more importantly, local Democratic activists professed to have come away energized, excited to have had face-to-face time with their partys most-important candidate: Its Hillary. Its a big deal for a Democratic activist to sit down at a coffee shop and meet her, Des Moines activist Peggy Huppert told BuzzFeed. This is what the campaign wanted  this kind of buzz.
