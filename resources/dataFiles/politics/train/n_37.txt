The Democratic Party of the late 19th Century and to basically mid 20th Century was hodgepodge of different political factions.. A candidate like Woodrow Wilson was someone who could appeal to both Northern Progressives and Southern White Rural voters

Any progressive in the early 20th Century had to deal with Southern Democrats to get any legislation passed. The election battle was in the Democratic Party primaries in the South, while the General Election was something like 98% of the vote to the Democratic Party nominee

The South was also different back then. it was very conservative, more rural, and much poorer than it is today. There was not the vested money interests that were powerful in Northern areas of the country, or the Railroads controlling state legislatures, like California..

Even with the Roosevelt Administration, they had to placate Southern Senators, like Jimmy Byrnes, even when he was defeating anti lynching legislation.
