Scott Walker Running on Faith
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Scott Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher, learned a lot about being a politician by going to church, the New York Times reports.

He was introduced to glad-handing while greeting worshipers beside his father after Sunday services. His confidence as a public speaker began at 2, when he delivered a Christmas greeting from the pulpit, and it blossomed when he preached occasional sermons as a teenager. And now, Mr. Walkers lifelong church involvement may be a powerful asset as he positions himself to run for the Republican presidential nomination and focuses on early primary and caucus states dominated by evangelical voters.
