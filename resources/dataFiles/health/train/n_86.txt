Lashes that flatter

Fancy a change to your usual black or brown mascara? Why not try a coloured one  but which colour should you go for? The answer: one that compliments the colour of your eyes.

Blue eyes  Bright blue mascara will make your blue eyes pop, or try a purple shade.

Brown eyes  Try navy blue if you have dark brown eyes, or purple if your eyes are lighter brown. Green will bring out the colour of your eyes too.

Hazel eyes  Go green to highlight the green tones in hazel eyes.

Green eyes  Purple and plum mascaras are the best for you (and the most flattering).

Recapture your winter glow

If your complexion needs a bit of a pick-me-up during the dark days of winter, try this make-up artist tip to bring some radiance back to your face.

Place a light dab of sheer glossy lip balm on the top of your cheekbones (not too much, you dont want to look gloopy) and another little dot above the middle of your upper lip (your Cupids bow). There, now dont you look gorgeous?

Eat your way to healthy hair

If your hair is looking a bit lacklustre, try boosting it with the following nutrients:

Vitamins C and E to protect hair follicles (citrus fruit, green vegetables, peppers, berries, avocado, spinach, nuts and seeds)

Zinc and selenium for healthy growth (pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds, whole grains, almonds, oats, Brazil nuts and walnuts)

Magnesium and manganese to protect against hair loss (brown rice, broccoli, bananas, beans, lentils and eggs)
