Medical News 'Tweets'
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Would you like to receive an update on a medical condition or disease that is of interest to you as soon as relevant news is published?

Now you can thanks to News-Medical.Net, TwitterFeed and Twitter.com. You can receive immediate notifications, either on your PC/Mac desktop or on your mobile phone.

Twitter is a free social networking and micro-blogging service that allows us to send out our medical news updates known as 'Tweets'. Tweets are text-based posts of up to 140 characters in length.

We 'Tweet' our news in one bundle across all topics and also provide individual 'Tweets' for core subjects listed below.

Here's how it works, it takes less than 3 mins to set up.

1. Click one of the links below that interests you and sign up as a Twitter user;

2. Then all you do is click on the "Follow" button and you will receive updates as soon as they are posted directly into your Twitter Page - it's that simple! You can also search for and follow many other users and sites in the same manner under the one Twitter account.

3. There are also many different Applications that enable you to view the Twitterfeeds you are "following" on devices such as the iPhone http://twitterforiphone.com/, Google Android enabled devices http://twidroid.com/ and BlackBerry http://dossy.org/twitter/blackbird/. Plus Tweetdeck http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/ is a really neat and free tool for organising your Twitter activities.

If you'd still like to know more, the Twitter people also provide a video to let you know how it works.

Happy Twittering!
