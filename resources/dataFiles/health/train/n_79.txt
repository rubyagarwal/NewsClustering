Taking care of carers

According to Carers UK, there are currently 6.5 million people acting as unpaid carers in this country, with many older carers having long-term health problems too. But its important for carers to look after themselves too:

Stay well by eating a healthy balanced diet, and try to stay as active as you can, whenever you can.

Dont delay seeing your GP if you develop any symptoms. If youre too busy to make an appointment, have a chat with your local pharmacist.

Remember to take time off every now and then to recharge your batteries. Ask your local authority about day care centres that could help give you a break.

Walk more, stay healthy

Instead of slowing down as you get older, you may be better off speeding up  at least where walking is concerned.

A study of almost a thousand adults, whose average age was 71, suggests those who walk more and at a faster pace are less likely to have a heart attack than others who walk less often or at a slower pace. The findings were published recently in the medical journal Circulation.

Find your purpose

If you have a sense of purpose in life, it could help you live longer than someone whos aimless, say experts writing in the journal Psychological Science.

There are several reasons why having a purpose in life could help older adults, especially those who have retired. But the research suggests that it may help younger people too.

Having goals or a purpose may also drive people to adopt healthier lifestyles  which, in turn, may help you live longer the authors of the report suggest.
