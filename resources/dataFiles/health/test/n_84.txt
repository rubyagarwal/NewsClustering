Q. What things trigger indoor allergies?

A. Common allergens include house dust mites, tiny microscopic insects that thrive in warm and humid environments like mattresses, carpets, soft furniture, pillows and beds. Dust mites are present all year round, but their numbers usually peak during spring and autumn.

Some people are also allergic to a substance in the saliva, dead skin flakes (dander) or urine of an animal with fur. Meanwhile, some indoor allergies can be triggered by an infestation of pests, such as mice or cockroaches. Another indoor allergy is triggered by tiny spores released into the air by moulds.

Indoor moulds and mildew need dampness, which is typically found in basements, bathrooms or anywhere with leaks. Fungal moulds can grow anywhere inside your house where there is natural material, such as wood, paper, food, plants and some types of insulation.

Finally, allergens such as chemicals, wood dust, latex, animals and flour dust are also found in some types of workplaces (occupational allergies).

Q. What are the symptoms of an indoor allergy?

A. The symptoms of an indoor allergy are similar to those of a cold. The early phase of an indoor allergy starts within minutes of exposure to an allergen, with symptoms including sneezing, running nose, blocked nose, itchy eyes, nose and throat, headache and rashes. In the late stage, which happens four to eight hours after exposure, symptoms include feeling tired, sleepy and generally unwell.

Q. How can you tell the difference between a cold and an indoor or winter allergy?

A. With winter allergies nasal secretions are clear and watery. You may also have itchy eyes and itchy throat, which you wouldnt have with a cold. The symptoms of allergy will persist for weeks and may be intermittent. With a cold, however, the nasal secretions are coloured, there may be chills and body aches, and the symptoms normally last for a few days.

Q. What happens in the body during an allergic reaction and why do some people react but not others?

A. When an allergen comes into contact with the nose and throat, a protein called immunoglobulin E (lgE) is released by the immune system. IgE causes other blood cells to release a chemical called histamine into the blood.

Histamine triggers irritation in the upper respiratory tract, making the respiratory passages swell and produce typical allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny or blocked nose, itchy and runny eyes. It also causes swelling of mucous membranes inside the nose causing congestion and the production of excess mucus.

Some people are more sensitive to allergens than others and can suffer serious allergy symptoms that may affect their quality of life. We don't know why it happens, but an over- sensitivity to allergens tends to run in families.

Q. What are the best medicines for indoor allergies and are they available over the counter?

A. Nasal decongestants and antihistamine tablets, which work by blocking the action of the chemical histamine in the body, are available to buy over the counter at pharmacies. These are recommended as the initial treatment for a mild to moderate indoor allergy.

Corticosteroids are also available at pharmacies in the form of nasal sprays, and are recommended if your symptoms are frequent or persistent and you have nasal congestion. Corticosteroids block many of the functions of the immune system and also help to reduce inflammation. They take longer to work than antihistamines, but their effects last longer. Side effects can include dryness and irritation of the nose.

There is also a new nasal spray on the market for adults and for children that is antihistamine and steroid free. It works by creating a barrier on the nasal lining and is suitable for pregnant and breastfeeding women as well. Ask your pharmacist for details.

Q. Are allergy medicines safe and suitable for everyone?

A. Nasal decongestants are only normally used for short-term relief. Using the spray for longer than five to seven days may make your symptoms worse. They can also interact with some anti-depressants and may not be suitable if you have high blood pressure. Do not use nasal decongestants while pregnant or breastfeeding. Children can only use some types of nasal drops if they are six or older.

Antihistamine tablets are not suitable for children under two years of age or pregnant and breastfeeding women. Some of them can cause drowsiness (if affected do not drive or operate machinery). Antihistamines are suitable for long term-use.

Corticosteriod nasal sprays are not suitable for children under 18 years of age, pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless on prescription.

These are not recommended to be used for more than three months without prescription.

Always check with your pharmacist before taking allergy medicines and let them know if you are on any other medication, if you have any medical conditions, or are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Q. What are the best ways of preventing indoor allergies?

A. Avoid the offending allergen as much as possible. With dust mites, for instance, reducing the number in your home may help. You can do this by removing cushions, toys and upholstered furniture, using a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, washing bedding weekly using a hot wash (55-60oC), using synthetic pillows and acrylic duvets instead of wool or feather, wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth and dusting the inside of cupboards too.

If you have pets keep them outside as much as possible or limit them to a room with no carpet. Dont allow them into the bedroom as their skin flakes can remain in the air for a long time. Wash pets at least once a fortnight (ideally, twice a week).

To prevent the growth of fungal moulds and spores reduce moisture around the bathroom, kitchen and other water areas of the home. Dehumidifiers help reduce both mould and dust mites. Limit yourself to a few house plants. Fix all leaks and other causes of damp areas. Clean mouldy surfaces. Keep your windows closed to prevent spores from coming in from the outside. Get rid of old foam pillows and mattresses. If you spot any fungal contamination, use a fungicide spray or cream to remove it.

Q. Can smoking make the symptoms of indoor allergies worse?

A. Smoking may aggravate allergies as cigarette smoke contains many toxic chemicals and irritants. Research suggests that children and spouses of smokers tend to have more respiratory infections and asthma than those of non-smokers.

Your pharmacist can help you give up smoking by offering nicotine replacement therapy (patches, spray, chewing gum, lozenges etc) and moral support. They can also monitor your progress and offer tips and advice to help you stop smoking. This is all part of the NHS stop smoking service, and the consultation is free.
