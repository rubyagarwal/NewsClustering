A mile a day could save lives

According to the Walking for Health campaign  run by Macmillan Cancer Support and the Ramblers  walking just one mile a day at a moderate pace (three miles per hour) could reduce prostate cancer patients risk of dying from the disease by almost a third.

We know that the health benefits of physical activity are incredible and this research highlights the very simple reality  walking can save lives, says Ciaran Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support.

Physical activity is a wonder drug and health care professionals must prescribe physical activity, such as walking, as a standard part of cancer recovery.

Slap it on

Skin cancer rates are rising faster in the over-60s in England than any other group, according to Public Health England figures. Thats why health experts at the World Congress on Cancers of the skin are urging middle-aged men to remember to use sunscreen next summer while doing the gardening, playing golf or washing the car.

Dont forget the tops of your ears, your neck and  if your hair is thinning  your scalp, and try to wear a hat when the sun is strong, skin experts advise.

Exercise for a better nights sleep

Fed up of your bladder waking you up during the night? Men who are physically active may wake up at night to urinate less frequently than those who do no exercise, say researchers writing in the American College of Sports Medicine.

Nocturia  the medical term for waking during the night more than once to urinate  is a common symptom in both men and women. If youre affected, see your GP as it could be a sign of a condition such as diabetes.

Another good reason to quit

Men who smoke before their babies are conceived could be putting them at greater risk of asthma, say experts at the European Respiratory Society International Congress.

Their report suggests non-allergic asthma is significantly more common in children with a father who smoked prior to conception. The risk is even greater in fathers who smoke before theyre 15, the scientists explain.

Which workers are most likely to hit the gym?

When it comes to sweating it out at the gym, some professions are more likely to get stuck in than others, says a survey by sports nutrition company Bodybuilding Warehouse.

Boys more likely to have SEN

The latest figures from the Department for Education shows boys in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed as having special education needs (SEN) than girls.

Of the 1.5 million state school children who have a learning difficulty or a disability that makes it harder for them to learn, 911,900 boys have SEN compared with 487,885 girls.

Speech and language difficulties along with behavioural and emotional issues are among the most common reasons children are diagnosed with SEN, claims a government analysis of the data.

Six-pack workout: Kettlebell swings

If youre following our series of super-charged abdominal exercises from celebrity personal trainer Scott Laidler (www.scottlaidler.com, @Scott_Laidler), heres the latest work-out move: kettlebell swings.

Although its not an abdominal isolation exercise, Ive included it in this ab workout because it requires the abs to be in their natural, braced position, says Scott. Plus the movement places significant demand on your abdominals throughout the exercise.

If you dont have any kettlebells, use a pair of dumbbells instead.

Stand with legs shoulder width apart. Swing the kettle bell behind you with a straight back and braced abdominals. Swing the kettle bell forward to chest height and repeat. The power must come from firing your glutes, and hamstrings, not the lower back.

Handsome men may be less fertile

Good news for guys who dont have a square jaw or male model looks. Masculine-looking men may find it easy to attract women, but the quality of their sperm may not be as good as that of their less masculine-looking counterparts, say researchers writing in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.
