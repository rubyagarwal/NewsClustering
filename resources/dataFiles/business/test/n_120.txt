When choosing a business school, most people rely on the professionals. Official rankings are themost influential source of information for people eyeing business school, according to a survey released this month by the Graduate Management Admission Council.

The second most popular source includes different groups of professionals: current students and alumni at graduate business programs.As part of Bloombergs2014 ranking of MBA programs, we asked almost10,000 graduating MBAsto rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, how strongly they agreed with the statement, I would encourage those looking for an MBA to enroll in my MBA program.

Our official rankings take into account lots of other factors, such asemployer opinions and academic quality. But when you measure schools on the unfiltered opinions of their students, Cinderellas emerge, likeMarylands Smith School, which ranked17th onourlist, beating Harvard and coming in secondfor reputation among its student body.

Keep in mind,most students give their own program rave reviews when filling out a survey they know will contribute to its ranking. Scores on this measurerangefrom 4.99 at the high end to 4.01,meaning everyone either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that theyd recommend their school to others. That makes the tiny differences between numbers more meaningful.

What students say: MBAopinions ofDardendont jibe with its 10-placetumble in our rankings lastyear. People cited the uncompromising academic standards and persistently engaged faculty for their good feelings about the program. One student said the first year at Darden is rigorous to the point that youll be overprepared for your summer internship experience, especially relative to Dardens peer schools. I had a military background and would easily say that I was in the top quartile of summer interns at my bank in terms of the knowledge required to perform my job.

What students say: Kellogg, a top-10 school on our list, did well among students because of its outstanding career management center and the collegial culture,which enhanced the experience, since most assignments were group-based.
