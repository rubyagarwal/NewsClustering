Its not been hacked sir, the person wrote from a Gmail account, identifying him or herself as a tesla press representative using a name thats been linked to earlier attacks on other companies.

The fraudulent posts were removed from the Twitter account within an hour.

Attacks on companies Twitter accounts have become commonplace. They often occur when people managing the account fail to turn on so-called two-factor authentication, which involves entering a code sent via text message to the owners phone, in addition to a password. The attackers are often mischief-makers who tweet out their own Twitter handles or identifying information on rivals.

Tesla spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn didnt immediately return a call to her mobile phone.
