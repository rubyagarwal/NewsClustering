Goldman Said to Lose Two Traders From Mortgage-Backed Bond Team
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. mortgage traders left the company this month, according to a person with knowledge of the departures.

The pair, Alexander Reiss and Costin Bontas, traded mortgage bonds guaranteed by government-backed entities, said the person, who asked not to be named because the information isnt public. Reiss and Bontas declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the bank.

Bontas is planning to join Michael Platts BlueCrest Capital Management, another person said. Ed Orlebar, a spokesman for Jersey-based BlueCrest, declined to comment.

Goldmans agency mortgage team last year lost traders including Joseph Walkush, who went to BlueCrest, and Paul Tietz, who joined Credit Suisse Group AG. The group is run by Carsten Schwarting, who reports to Jeffrey Verschleiser, head of the global mortgage business.

The agency mortgage group this month added Tyler Gottlieb from Morgan Stanley as a vice president, said the first person. Last year, it hired Takuya Negoro from Barclays Plc as a managing director in Toyko and Sumit Kumar from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in New York.

Goldmans mortgage trading business generated an average of about $1.6 billion in annual revenue over the past five years, according to a February presentation from the bank.

Reiss joined Goldman Sachs in 2009 after almost a decade at BlackRock Inc. while Bontas arrived at the bank in 2010 from Citadel Securities LLC, according to regulatory records.
