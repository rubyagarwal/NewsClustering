The Crash-Proof Car in the Works at BMW
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
At BMWs Research and Innovation Center in Munich, an experimental high-tech safety system is under development. Its called 360-degree collision avoidance and it can prevent a car from crashing into any stationary object. The precise laser sensors and sophisticated algorithms involved could be a step towards a totally self-driving car - and a future without traffic accidents. Bloombergs Sam Grobart visited BMW to take the prototype for a test drive. (Video by: Alan Jeffries, Justin Beach) (Source: Bloomberg)
