China to Be SunPowers Fastest-Growing Region, CEO Werner Says
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
China is becoming SunPower Corp.s fastest-growing market following an agreement to build two solar farms there with Apple Inc., Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner said.

Well get a lot of business in China, Werner said Friday on Bloomberg Radio. It will be our fastest-growing region in the next five years, by far. The challenge is how you do that profitably. That code hasnt been broken by many Western companies.

Apple and San Jose, California-based SunPower said April 16 that they expected to finish construction on two 20-megawatt projects in Sichuan Province in the fourth quarter. Financial terms werent disclosed.

Apple powers all of its data centers with clean energy and is seeking to run 100 percent of its facilities on renewables, according to its website. For SunPower, the agreement boosts the status of the second-biggest U.S. solar maker in the worlds largest solar market.

When we go to finance our projects in China, having Apple co-own those projects is such a strong credibility boost that it allows us then to get the rest of the financing in a very economical way, Werner said. Its a stamp of approval from the most respected brand on the planet.

Researchers associated with Chinas central bank on Wednesday proposed committing about $16 billion to clean-energy investments.

China is the worlds biggest consumer of coal and the air quality is not very good, Werner said. Thats not going to work longterm. They need more and more renewable energy.
