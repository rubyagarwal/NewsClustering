Chiltern Firehouse Chef to Open Tavern by Londons Square Mile
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
Nuno Mendes, the chef who cooks for celebrities from David Beckham to Lindsay Lohan at Chiltern Firehouse, plans to open a tavern next month thats very different in style from the fashionable London restaurant.

Taberna do Mercado in Spitalfields market, on the edge of the citys financial district, will be an informal venue, open all day. It will mainly serve food and wine from Mendess native Portugal and will seat about 40 people.

Mendes will stay on as executive chef at Chiltern Firehouse, which is owned by the U.S. hotelier Andre Balazs, and quickly became a hangout for movie stars, models and entertainers when it opened last year.

Mendes won a Michelin star for his creative gastronomy at Viajante in East London, before it closed and the Portuguese chef moved to Chiltern Firehouse. Before that, he served dishes such as pork jowl cooked in cinnamon-scented oil and served with langoustine, leek and rosewater puree at a pub called Bacchus.

Taberna do Mercado will have a soft opening with reduced prices from May 4-10. Bookings can be made, online only, from April 29 via the website http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/. The plan was announced by EightyFour, a public-relations company.
