BOJ Shouldnt Ease Further; Yen Fell Enough: Business Lobby Head
HEADLINE_ARTICLE
The Bank of Japan shouldnt expand its record monetary stimulus, as such a move would fail to spur growth and make prospects for an eventual exit from the policy harder, the new head of a business lobby said.

The yen has slumped enough on the back of the central banks asset purchases over the past two years and the currency should stay around 120 per dollar, said Yoshimitsu Kobayashi, who starts Monday as chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives.

The BOJ is scattering about 300 trillion yen expanding its monetary base, but the effect hasnt trickled down, and I dont think they can invigorate things with such unnatural actions, Kobayashi, who is also chairman of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp., said in an interview Friday in Tokyo. Any exit is growing more distant. Its not sustainable.

Abenomics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abes three-pronged economic strategy, has yet to convince some business owners to invest in Japan, Kobayashi said. From here, Japans economic fortunes will depend on whether the premier can spur real growth with regulatory reforms while the BOJs easing buys time, Kobayashi said.

Kobayashi praised the Abes move to start lowering corporate taxes as speedy, while saying the rate should ultimately be cut to 25 percent to make Japan competitive with China and South Korea. Japans parliament last month approved a corporate income tax cut by 3.29 percentage points to be implemented over two years from an effective rate of about 35 percent.

Investment for Japan is unusually low, Kobayashi, 68, said. As we head toward the Olympics and try to have foreigners make investments as well as coming for sightseeing, we need the rate to be reduced at least to 25 percent. The sooner, the better.

In U.S. currency terms, 300 trillion yen is about $2.5 trillion.
